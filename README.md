# nbacharts
A project of 3 different data visualization charts that I did at the request of a friend.

These are data visualization projects I completed using RStudio. The main two libraries used were nbastatR and ggplot2. The project includes the R script files along with an exported PNG of the completed charts.
Descriptions of the charts are:
  1. A bar graph displaying Chris Paul's mid-range shooting percentage over the first 3 seasons of his career and this season. The goal of the chart was to show how much Paul has improved his midrange shooting over his career, and how good it was this season.
  2. A multiplot shot chart showing 4 different chart. Each one is either JJ Redick or Duncan Robinson's shooting statistics this season. There is one chart for each of the players' shots from spot-up situations, and another from one or two dribble shots. The shots are color coded for makes and misses and include a legend.
  3. A bar graph showing the top 10 scorers in the NBA return bubble in Orlando. Player profile images and total point annotations are attached to their bar on the chart. Stats up to 8/9/2020
